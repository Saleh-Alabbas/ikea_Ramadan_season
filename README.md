Exploratory Analysis

This is a Kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedkallam/ikea-sa-furniture-web-scraping) that was collected by web scraping the IKEA Saudi Aribia website: https://www.ikea.com/sa/en/cat/furniture-fu001/

the data was collected at 2020-04-20 (27 Shaaban 1441, Three days before Ramadan month).
which mean that the data was collected at the beginning of Ramadan season.

Exploring the data is the main focus of this project.
some questions, on wether the holy month of Ramadan is considered as a discount season or not, are investegated.
